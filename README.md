# Password-Generator-Random

## Description

This challenge required me to generate a random password between 8 to 128 characters using uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol characters. A starter code was provided, but many functions and if/else statements were added to generate the random password based on the criteria listed above. 

## Installation

My responsibility was to satisfy the acceptance criteria, create a new repository on GitHub, commit and push any changes to the repository, and deploy to GitHub Pages to view the website live. The HTML code is available on index.html, the CSS code is available on style.css, and JavaScript code is available on script.js in the password-generator-random folder.

## Usage

Based on the code in the HTML and CSS, the web page was set up where you would click "generate password", be presented with a variety of prompts, and a random password is then generated. 

The challenge has been deployed after ensuring all criteria was met.
